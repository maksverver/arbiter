This is an arbiter for the board game Ayu as played during the CodeCup.

Ayu, short for "Attach Your Units" is a dynamic-connection game invented by
Luis Bola√±os Mures.  For details, see:

The arbiter does not enforce time and memory limits or any other restrictions.
This allows easier testing with clients that were not written to comply with the
CodeCup rules. However, the arbiter does verify that all programs follow the
rules (i.e. play only valid moves).
