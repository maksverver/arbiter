This is an arbiter for the board game Poly-Y as played during the CodeCup.

The arbiter does not enforce time and memory limits or any other restrictions.
This allows easier testing with clients that were not written to comply with the
CodeCup rules. However, the arbiter does verify that all programs follow the
rules (i.e. play only valid moves).
